I was told the best way to practice your skills is to apply it to something you have a passion for or love. 
As a huge F1 fan, it was about time to explore the famous FastF1 dataset.

This project:
- analyses open source F1 telemetry datasets using Python (pandas, matplotlib).
- Simulated test and validation workflows by detecting anomalies in braking, throttle, and speed traces.
-  Demonstrated how data analysis can support performance validation by linking anomalies and cornering behaviour to lap time outcomes.

This is my first encounter with this dataset and I'm looking forward to exploring it further and seeing what else it can be used for.
